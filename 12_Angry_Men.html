            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>On paper, 12 Angry Men sounds like the perfect movie to sleep through. The entire film is only set in one room, there are only 12 actors, and it's in black and white. But yet, somehow, the setting never gets boring, the characters never become uninteresting, and the style of filming never make it feel outdated.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">To investigate why this is, let's first talk about the acting.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The acting in the film is remarkable - the emotions the actors portray are absolutely flawless, and make the entire movie feel incredibly lifelike. The development of the characters throughout the film are enough to carry the movie, as their changing opinions and realizations are interesting and compelling. In addition, the cinematography in the film is simply incredible. The camera always seems to follow the action well, and in moments of heightened tension, the camera angles expertly convey a sense of claustrophobia. One shot in particular caught my attention, in the scene where Juror #1 changes his vote to not guilty. The camera expertly zooms in on his face just below his eye level, and you can perfectly see the emotional anguish and the sweat all over his face. Another great shot was in the second to last scene, when Juror #8 brings Juror #3 his coat. This scene’s cinematography is beautiful, and shots like these are all over the film. Another aspect to laud is the film’s sparing use of music. When it is played, it gives a more light-hearted feel to the movie and gives the scenes much more variance and significance. However, it’s not just the cinematography and music that make the movie so memorable; it’s the biases and virtues the characters express that are still relevant to our society.</span></p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text counter-container col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Overconfidence&nbsp;</strong>- Overconfidence is one of the most common biases throughout 12 Angry Men, but can most often be seen with Juror #3, who was overconfident right until the very end. He believed that there was no way the boy couldn’t have killed his dad, and would 
have sent the boy to death because of this bias.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anchoring</strong>&nbsp;- Anchoring is the cognitive bias in which a certain idea that may be a fallacy is believed as an absolute fact, when in reality it may or may not be true. Juror #4 experiences the effects of anchoring, but he is able to get past this once he comes to a realization. Juror #4 believed that the girl’s testimony offered irrefutable evidence, and that it was absolutely, without question, completely correct. However after Juror #11 points out that the girl may have seen the events incorrectly, Juror #4 changed his mind.
</li><li><strong>Bandwagon</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> - Almost all the Jurors were a victim to the bandwagon effect, a bias in which someone takes up a certain mindset or viewpoint simply because “everyone else is doing it”. When the Jurors initially sit down, Juror #1 asks for their views, and at least 5 people wait to put their hands up, and simply do what everyone else is doing. This bias is incredibly dangerous, especially as this film shows, as the boy was actually innocent, and most people only voted the way they did because other people were doing it.
</span></li><li><strong>Fundamental Attribution Error </strong>- Another bias in play is the fundamental attribution error, which can be seen throughout the movie. One example is when Juror #10 states, “Children from the slums are nothing but potential menaces to society”. Immediately after he says this, Juror #5 steps in to say that he was born in a slum, invalidating Juror #5’s point.  
</li><li><strong>What You See Is All There Is </strong>- Next is the idea of “what you see is all there is”, or WYSIATI. One scene this can be seen in is near the end of the film, when Juror #10 states,”You know these people, they’re born liars!” While this is very similar to the previous bias, this bias creates the illusion of truth, and makes Juror #10 treat this mistaken belief as though it is absolute truth.
</li><li><strong>Halo Effect </strong>- Another cognitive bias is the halo effect, in which an impression or idea created in one area influences an opinion in a completely unrelated area. Juror #7 falls victim to this, specifically when he says that the boy had some ‘bad history’, and had committed some other offenses before this. Before the end of the movie, it is revealed that these may have been overblown, and made to seem a lot more problematic than they actually were.
</li><li><strong>Confirmation Bias </strong>- Many Jurors at the start of the movie acted with confirmation bias, as during the first vote, almost everyone voted guilty. This initial bias swayed all future evidence towards their existing belief, giving the effect that the boy was guilty without any doubt.

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Courage</strong>&nbsp;- Courage is very prevalent throughout the film, but is most obvious during the first vote. 11 of the jurors believed that the boy killed his father, but Juror #8 thought there was a reasonable doubt as to wether or not he had actually killed his dad. Due to this, Juror #8 voted not guilty, despite being the only person to believe so, which takes a lot of courage to do.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wisdom</strong> - While there were many scenes and actions that represented wisdom, there was one person who seemed to personify it: Juror #9. He wasn’t particularly vocal throughout the film, but when he had a point to make, everyone seemed to agree on it, as what he had to say was usually very knowledgeable and intelligent.
</li>
                    <li><strong>Justice</strong> - Instead of applying justice to a certain scene or character, I thought justice applied to the film as a whole. The plot of the film revolves around delivering justice to a boy, and the 12 jurors deliberate about what is fair and what isn’t.
</li><li><strong>Moderation </strong>- Very few characters in 12 Angry Men showed lots of moderation, and a select few people seemed to dominate the verbal discussion throughout the film. But one character who showed moderation in the way they spoke was Juror #4, who only gave his opinions when he was directly spoken to. He was very calm when he spoke, and never interrupted anyone else.
</li><li><strong>Humanity </strong>- Many characters throughout the film mention different ideas of humanity, but Juror #11 often acted with the virtue of humanity in mind. He repeatedly pushed others to look further into the case not because they had to, but because somebody’s life was on the line. This shows an empathetic concern, something few other people showed.

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Paul Bloom believes that empathy is dangerous because it can easily be taken advantage of, and many people in this film would agree with that. One particular character is Juror #10, who is a dominating and spirited fighter of the idea that the boy is guilty. Juror #10 refuses to feel empathy for the boy, as he believes that feeling such empathy would result in the freedom of a guilty man. Paul Bloom would most likely argue that this man acts in the most just and fair manner.<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Daniel Goleman believes that emotional intelligence is something that society needs to function. Based on this, we can safely make the assumption that Goleman would agree most with Juror #5. Juror #5 grew up in a slum, and he therefore knows most about what it’s like to live like the boy did. He repeatedly offered up his input, which was often based on his time living in a slum. Juror #5 uses his experiences to make the other jurors more aware and empathetic of the boy’s living conditions.<br></p>
